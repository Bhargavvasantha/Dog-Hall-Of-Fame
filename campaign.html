            >The Dog Hall of Fame, was established in 2003 to honor pets which,
            with their owners, have stood out above the rest over a period of
            several years.
            <br />
            <br />
            Each had made over 250 visits and had contributed in several other
            ways to significantly advance the pet-visitation therapy program.
            All inductions into the Hall of Fame are made following retirement
            and most often posthumously.</strong
